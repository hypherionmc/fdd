## First Dark Development - Contributors/Developers Policy

This document serves as a sort of Code of Conduct for developers and contributors to First Dark Development projects.

### Code Formatting

While I (HypherionSA), generally slack on this, code formatting is important. Having messy, unformatted code, makes it difficuilt for the next person to work with.

General code formatting rules:

* Use 2 tabs for spaces
* Name variables, methods and classes properly. Don't call it DoCheck, rather call it doInventoryCheck (camel-case)
* When a line of code gets too long, use line breaks at full-stops.
* When renaming a class, method or variable, use "Refactor" instead of just renaming it.
* If you code a complex function, especially rendering stuff, ADD COMMENTS!
* When copying vanilla code and making changes, document what changes you made and why

### Code Sharing

Most of our projects are now licensed under MIT, making it possible to re-use and even share the code as you wish. 

Some projects are Closed source either due to Licensing, Private API's or API keys. In the event that you have access to this, IT'S FOR YOUR EYES ONLY! Do not share it with other developers who are not part of the project, and definitely do NOT share it online! 
Re-using code from private repos without permission will get you kicked out and you may possibly get a DMCA notice against your project where the code is used.

### General code of conduct

Just be friendly. That's key. When speaking to fellow developers, users or staff members, be NICE. Don't take out your bad day on them.

Sometimes, most of the times, people DON'T read the docs before asking a question. In that case, kindly redirect them to the docs and ask them to revert back if they need any further help.

*We all make mistakes!*. When a fellow developer tells you, they disagree with your code, then don't argue. Rather listen to what they have to say, and if needed, defend your decision.

Nobody is ALWAYS correct. Your way of doing things, may not be the same way someone else would do it. It doesn't mean that ANY of you are wrong.

### If you're unsure, ASK

If you're unsure of anything, please ask! Don't just go ahead an do something that could've been avoided.
